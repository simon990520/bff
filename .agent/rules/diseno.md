Web UI Style Guide Based on Reference

Design and implement a web interface inspired by a modern 3D avatar creation app. The UI must feel warm, minimal, premium, and friendly. Follow these rules:

1. General Aesthetic

Minimalist, soft, and inviting design.

Warm pastel color palette (peach, cream, light beige, soft whites).

Rounded corners everywhere.

Clean spacing with generous white space.

Light shadows to create a premium feel.

2. Main Layout Structure

The page layout must replicate the structure of a modern iOS-style app:

Top section: simple header / status feeling.

Center area: a large 3D avatar as the main focal element.

Bottom area: a rounded text input card + main CTA button.

Everything must be vertically centered and visually balanced.

3. Avatar Section

Place a large avatar in the center of the screen.

Avatar should occupy around 50% of the viewport height.

Add a subtle glow or shadow under the avatar to simulate floating depth.

Keep the background clean and light.

4. Floating Action Icons

Above the avatar, position two floating circular icon buttons:

Left: Home icon.

Right: Share icon.

Buttons must be rounded, minimal, and soft, matching the warm UI style.

5. Input Area

Place a rounded white card under the avatar.

It should look like a soft floating box.

Include a friendly placeholder text such as:

“Tell us what you’d like to create…”

Use subtle drop shadow and smooth borders.

6. Primary CTA Button

Large pill-shaped button centered at the bottom.

Warm gradient color (soft orange → peach).

Bold but friendly text, e.g., “CREATE”.

Slight elevation shadow to feel clickable.

7. Typography

Use a modern, clean sans-serif font.

Soft, rounded font preference if available.

Maintain clear hierarchy:

Large readable UI labels

Soft tone, friendly communication

8. Emotional & Visual Tone

Friendly

Creative

Safe

Premium yet approachable

9. Interaction Feel

Animations should be smooth and subtle.

Avoid harsh transitions or aggressive colors.

UI should feel soft and delightful.

10. Design Constraints

Avoid clutter.

Avoid dark or aggressive contrasting colors.

Avoid sharp corners.

Keep focus on the avatar + primary interaction.
